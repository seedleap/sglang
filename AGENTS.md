## MinWM hardware-specific jobs

When a task creates or changes a MinWM deployment or benchmark manifest:

1. Read `benchmark/minwm_realtime_parity/HARDWARE_PROFILES.md`.
2. Start from `benchmark/minwm_realtime_parity/k8s/minwm_hardware_job.template.yaml`.
3. Select the profile from measured GPU memory and compute capability. Never infer
   capacity from a product name alone.
4. Render one-off manifests under
   `benchmark/minwm_realtime_parity/k8s/generated/`. This directory is ignored;
   do not commit dated, region-specific, run-specific, or instance-specific YAML.
5. Preserve the MinWM checkpoint/request invariants in the profile document.
6. Validate generated YAML before applying it and report the selected profile,
   detected hardware, memory gate, and any unvalidated assumptions.

Only update the committed template when the reusable schema changes. Only update
the hardware profiles when new evidence changes a stable decision or validation
status.
